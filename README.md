# Sandbox-Please-Ignore
Personal sandbox code for me to exercise and experiment with github + associated features (e.g. travis-ci, waffle.io)

Goals
----

I'm hoping to find ways to elegantly add performance profiling and
regression testing to the Continuous Integration process on github.

Setup
----

The current setup uses python as a (currently non-existent) codebase
with a single dependency on numpy.

Travis-CI
----

This sandbox exercises simple pytest tests using travis-ci.
